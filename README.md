# SWM Project Readme

Welcome to the SWM (Semantic Web Mining) project! This project aims to extract and analyze information from unstructured text data using natural language processing and semantic technologies.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to download and install Apache Solr and MetaMap:

1. Apache Solr: Download the latest version of Apache Solr from the official website (https://lucene.apache.org/solr/downloads.html). Once downloaded, unzip the package and follow the installation instructions in the Solr documentation.

2. MetaMap: Download MetaMap from the official website (https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/MainDownload.shtml). Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `CODE`: Contains all the codes of all the components used for the entire project.

- `EVALUATIONS`: Contains test queries used to evaluate the accuracy of our implementation.

- `DATA`: Contains links to the crawled data. As the data size was huge, we stored it in a shared drive to make it accessible.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SWM project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

2. Install Apache Solr and MetaMap as described above.

3. Start Apache Solr and create a new core.

4. Index the data using Apache Solr.

5. Run the SWM code to perform semantic analysis on the indexed data.

## Conclusion

We hope you find this project useful and informative. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or feedback.
